parrot-ar-controller
====================

Libraries and utilities for controlling the Parrot AR 2.0 series of quadcopters.


The main [Parrot AR.Drone API](https://projects.ardrone.org/projects/show/ardrone-api)
is an official product of the company, which is the first idea behind this rehash.
The second library is a Java reconstruction of the entire protocol called
[Javadrone](https://code.google.com/p/javadrone/). A possible design could be a
combination of the two design concepts.
